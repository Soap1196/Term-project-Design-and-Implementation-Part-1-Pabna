To run code ensure you have all Javafx jars installed in your environemnt and make your selections 
for for each leaf and composite object in the treeview pane in the upper left hand corner.

I also added the external jar file we used for running some of the base tello commands in case that
is needed, it may be slightly different than the one provided by dr rana but we only ever used 
the rotation and fly forward command.

IMPORTANT: when creating a new item or container make sure that a node like root node is selected to
to get it to register, even when creating one for the first time.
